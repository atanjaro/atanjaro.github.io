## Software

Here are some software projects I have been involved with:

### VariationalMC
- This package implements the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method for the Hubbard model and (to be added) models of electron-phonon interaction
- [GitHub](https://github.com/atanjaro/VariationalMC.jl)

### SmoQyDQMC
- This package implements the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method for Hubbard, and electron-phonon interactions, including both Holstein and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) style electron-phonon coupling.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/SmoQySuite/SmoQyDQMC.jl)
