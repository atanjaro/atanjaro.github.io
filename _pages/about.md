Greetings! Thank you for visiting my website.
------

I am a graduate research assistant in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville (UTK). I have been working in the strongly correlated electrons group of Professor Steven Johnston since 2020. My work focuses on using Monte Carlo methods to solve problems involving models of electron-electron and electron-boson interactions.
