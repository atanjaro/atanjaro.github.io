Thank you for visiting my website.

I am a theoretical condensed matter physicist and Ph.D. student in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville (UTK). I have been working in the group of Professor Steven Johnston since 2020 and have a strong interest in investigating quantum materials with novel properties. A unifying theme of my research is how multiple ordering tendencies compete and coexist in strongly correlated systems. I investigate how these competing interactions shape collective phases such as magnetism and unconventional superconductivity using state-of-the-art Monte Carlo simulations of model Hamiltonians. The Hubbard model is often considered to be the "standard model" of strong correlations but it may not necessarily be a complete one, as it does not include lattice degrees of freedom.
