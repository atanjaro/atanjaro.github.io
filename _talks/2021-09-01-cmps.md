Several state-of-the-art numerical methods have observed static and fluctuating spin and charge stripes in doped two-dimensional Hubbard models, suggesting that these orders significantly shape the cuprate phase diagram. Many experiments, however, also indicate that the cuprates have strong electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling, and it is unclear how this interactioninfluences stripe correlations. We study static and fluctuating stripe order in the doped Hubbard-Holstein model using zero temperature variational Monte Carlo and finite temperature determinant quantum Monte Carlo. We find that the lattice couples more strongly with the charge component of the stripes, leading to an enhancement or suppression of stripe correlations, depending on model parameters like the next-nearest-neighbor hopping t′. Our results help elucidate how the e-ph interaction can tip the delicate balance between stripe and superconducting correlations in the Hubbard-Holstein model with implications for our understanding of the high-Tc cuprates.
